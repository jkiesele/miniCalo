ADDING R-HADRONS TO GEANT4

This is an example of how to add gluino and stop R-hadrons to
Geant4. The code contained within this example is described in

INTRODUCTION:

The code in this example is based upon the N03 novice example so the
similarities in the basic structure is no coincidence. Our additions
to the code fall into three cathegories:

1) Adding particles to Geant4 at run-time.

This is done by introducing the CustomParticle class which inherits
from G4ParticleDefinition. The CustomParticleFactory then selectively
breaks the singleton property of the class based on configuration
files.

2) Adding processes (and possibly decays) for the new particles.

In the naming convention here there are two possible hadronic
processes. These are:

- G4GenericHadronicProcess: A full parametrised process which is used
  in publications.

- GenericHadronicProcess: A toy-model which is somewhat easier to
  understand. The model is described in publications but is not used
  for physics conclusions.

They are added to instantiated CustomParticles in
ExRhadPhysicsList.cc. The default process is the full parametrised
process.


SETTING UP THE EXAMPLE

- Configuration

The example is configured using the setup.sh script. No csh-style
script has been made yet. The user needs to set the G4INSTALL and
ROOTSYS variables in the script or set them manually and comment out
the corresponding lines in the file.

Now write:

. setup.sh
make


The last two lines of the output should be:


Linking exampleRhad ...
... Done!


- Physics Configuration

The package relies on four run-time text files to specify the physics configuration. These are:

particles.txt: 
The list of heavy hadrons. The heavy parton *must* be the first in the
list.

RhadronProcessList.txt:
The list of hadronic processes possible.

PhysicsConfiguration.txt:
Sets up cross section resonances and charge exchange suppression factors.

decays.txt:
Contains the list of possible decays of particles


The data directory contains setups for gluinos @ 200, 300, 500 & 800 GeV, stops @ 


RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

The mymacro.mac file illustrates the use of the package. It sets up a
geometry (a block of iron) and runs 1000 ~g_rho+ particles through
it with a flat distribution in kinetic energies. Assuming this is run
on a Linux machine it is run by writing:

exampleRhad mymacro.mac

(The executable should have been added to your path)

A couple of things should be noted about the default configuration:

- Stepping and stacking actions are in place discarding all particles
  which are not R-hadrons. They can be commented out in the main
  program. The relevant classes are:
	ExRhadSteppingAction
	MyStackingAction

- Classes exemplifying the use of sensitive volumes and hits are
  available and the use of them is illustrated in an analysis
  class. The relevant classes are:
	MySensitiveTracker
	MyTrackerHit
	MyAnalysis

Best of luck.
